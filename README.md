The Gaming Room had a game application, Draw It or Lose It, that was created for Android systems. Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application renders images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit. The client was interested in expanding their gaming app to multiple platforms using various software patterns in a distributed environment. Specifically, before making a decision, The Gaming Room asked for an evaluation of the three traditional operating platforms (Linux, Mac, and Windows), as well as mobile platforms, for how the game application software could be deployed and run and what would be required to do so. A report was compiled, consisting of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each platfor. This helped to inform their decision on the benefits of each platform and their utility in a distributed environment.
